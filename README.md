# Kinforma

## About:
  In collaboration with Digital Design (DD25) and Computer Graphics (CG25) students also studying at Yrgo, together we created a responsive landing page for a fictional outdoor brand called Kinforma. The site is purely cosmetic and was meant to fine tune our CSS skills and introduce us to working with other design teams mimicking industry standards.

## Tech Used:
  HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
  How to work together efficiently across multiple teams. It was essential to balance time and expectations for each other, it was a great practice in communication and team work.
